- Send a message from agent to server

- Server: Read private key from $WHAZZA_KEY / $WHAZZA_KEY_FILE / ./whazza.key
- Server: If private key does not exist, create it and log it to output

- 'agent init localhost:1234 _public_key_' should generate a default configuration for the agent
- agent should try to read a private key the same way as server does
- when first generating the private key, print message to add the public key to servers list of authorized agents

- Server: 'whazza agent add <public_key> <name> [environment...]'
